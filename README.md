# cvgen

**cvgen** is a web app that automatically generates digital CVs. The objective of this project is to help people,
specially the young ones, to build their own CVs without too much difficulties. In high school I've had a lot of doubts
on how to build a good curriculum, what information should I display to the recruiter, how to organize it...

It was a hella fun and challenging project, I'm not a big fan of front-end development or JavaScript, to be honest, I
was planning to use PHP to build this tool but, I'm still not able to rent a VPS Server.

## Technologies

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JS
No framework were used during the development of this project.

## Usage
**cvgen has a good user interface and you probably will not have problems to undersand how the software works.

# Support
If you'd like to support the project, I would appreciate some help on translating it to other languages. Currently
the languages avaliabe are English and Brazilian Portuguese.
